# Lies, Damn Lies, and Code Coverage

Contains example projects and other information from my talk "Lies, Damn Lies, and Code Coverage" given at the 2022 [dev up](https://www.devupconf.org/) conference in St. Louis, MO (St. Charles, MO).

## Example Projects

The following two TypeScript Node.js projects were used in the talk:

- bowling-kata - A simple function that calculates the score of a bowling game given an array of pins knocked down per throw of the bowling ball.
- project-estimator - A simple function that calculates the number of QA individuals a project should have based on the number of developers on the team.
